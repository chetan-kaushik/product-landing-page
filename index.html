        <h5>PASSIVE NOISE ISOLATION</h5>

        <h5>LIGHTWEIGHT AND INCREDIBLY STRONG</h5>
        PRO headset is built to be extremely lightweight, strong and extremely comfortable. To achieve that, PRO
        headset uses advanced materials including TR90 nylon in the headband, stainless steel sliders, and glass fiber
        reinforced nylon joints. The lightweight construction with polymer shell and fork is perfect for long periods
        of wear and competitive gaming.
